# Public-School-District
You are a data analyst working for the superintendent of a large public school district in Portugal. The superintendent wants to know what factors affect student grades in core subjects and what changes can be made to improve student performance. Your team is going to analyze performance data on high school student achievement in two Portuguese public schools, Gabriel Pereira (GP) and Mousinho da Silveira (MS). The data was collected by the school district by means of academic reports and student surveys. The data includes information such as:
Student grades
Student background information 
Student study time
Student participation in extracurricular activities

By sorting the data, you’ve discovered a potential problem with the data. Because this dataset represents high school student achievement, any age older than 18 may indicate that a mistake was made when entering that student's age. You now know what age data may need to be researched and corrected. Your next step is to ask the superintendent about the legitimate age range for students in public high school. Then, you’ll know what age data is incorrect and should be removed. 
The superintendent tells you that the maximum age limit for which public education is provided is 19 years old and that the age range should be 15-19 for both schools. Any student outside this age range should be deleted from the dataset. 
The superintendent wants to know what factors influence student performance, and a student’s reason for choosing a specific school will be important to know for analysis. The reason column shows the main reason a student chose to enroll in a specific school, according to their survey response: for example, because of the school’s reputation, or because it offers certain courses,  etc. So, you need to make sure the reason column is complete and without blanks. 

In this case, the superintendent wants to know if a parent’s education level is a significant factor in student performance. The relevant data is in the Medu and Fedu columns--which, respectively, refer to the level of education of a student’s mother and father. Currently, the data is in text format. For the purposes of analysis, it will be useful to know the average education level of each student’s parents. To make this calculation, you first need to convert the data in the Medu and Fedu columns to number format.
